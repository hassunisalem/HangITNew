# HangIT

This is an old version of our project. The new website consist of a outside template, that i've edited to suit out needs.

I want do want to stress, that this version have a lack of **Refactoring** as i was the only one working on this code and
we had a lack of time, i did'nt put in much effort in terms of clean looking code. I do see now, that it'd still help myself in the end, as reading this code from long ago is harder
than it could have been. 
The code, espacially in the file *Chart.js*, needs to be broken down into smaller components and imported acordingly.

The reason i choose showcase this version for *Get Louis* is, to demonstrate that i've written most of the code and implemented various libraries here myself.
